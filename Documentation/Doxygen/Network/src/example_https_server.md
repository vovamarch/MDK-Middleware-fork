# HTTPS Server {#Compact_Secure_Web_Server_Example}

This example implements an HTTPS Server on a device that can be accessed from a computer connected to the same network.

The example uses a fixed set of web pages stored in ROM, but is capable of exchanging information with the underlying hardware by using the CGI interface. The HTTPS server uses the ARM mbed TLS software component to enable \ref secure_communication.

The following picture shows an exemplary connection of the development board and a Computer.

## Project Organization

The HTTP Server project is available as part of the \ref nw_ref_example "Network Reference Example".

**Application Source Files**

 - `HTTPS_Server.c.c` contains the main C function that initializes the board hardware and the Network Component.
 - `HTTPS_Server_CGI.c.c` defines the functions for the scripting language for communication with the hardware.
 - `/Web/` directory contains all the HTML and CGI files that will be compiled into the `Web.c` file. The files in this group determine the actual layout of the web page and the behaviour of the different refs using CGI.
 - `/Web/Web.c` is a compiled file that will be generated by the \urlout{uv4_ut_fcarmuv} tool from all the web input files.

**Configuration Files for Software Components**

Configuration files for the software components used in the project are available in the `/RTE/` directory and can be modified by users to adjust the operation of related components. Section TBD gives an overview about the components and their dependencies.

Following configuration files are provided with this example:

 - For the Network component, in `/RTE/Network/` folder:
   - `Net_Config_HTTP_Server.h`: \ref ws_configuration "HTTP Server configuration"..
   - `Net_Config_TCP.h`: \ref using_network_sockets_tcp_conf "TCP Socket configuration".
   - `Net_Config_UDP.h`: \ref using_network_sockets_udp_conf "UDP Socket configuration".
   - `Net_Config_ETH_0.h`: \ref using_ethernet_interfaces_conf "Ethernet Interface configuration".
   - `Net_Config.h`: \ref nw_Network_Core "Network Core configuration".
   - `Net_Security.c`: file with keys and certificates. Default values are used by default, for changing them refer to \ref cert_creation.
   - `Net_Debug.h`: \ref netDebugConfig "Network Debug configuration".
 - For mbedTLS component, in `/RTE/Security/` folder:
   - `mbedTLS_config.h`, `mbedTLS_crypto_config.h`: [mbedTLS configuration files](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-mbedTLS).
 - For the CMSIS components, in the `/RTE/CMSIS/` folder:
   - `RTX_Config.h` and `RTX_Config.h`: [CMSIS-RTX Configuration files](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS-RTX/latest/config_rtx5.html) for the RTOS Kernel.

When a board layer is added to the project, corresponding configuration files for the board and device components will become available in the local `/RTE/` directory as well.

**Board Layer**

In order to build the HTTPS Server project it shall be extended with a compatible board layer that provides following CMSIS-Driver interfaces as [connections](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cmsis-toolbox/blob/main/docs/ReferenceApplications.md#connections):
 - `CMSIS_ETH`
 - `CMSIS_VIO`
 - `STDOUT`

## Build the Project

Open the **Network** Reference Example and select **HTTPS Server** as an active project for the build process. Make sure the compatible board layer is configured.

Section [Working with MDK-Middleware Examples](../General/working_with_examples.html) explains in more details how to access, configure and build an MDK-Middleware example project for your target hardware.


## Run the Example

**Hardware Setup**

Board-specific setup such as jumpers, Ethernet ports, power supply, etc. is documented in the board layer description (`README.md`) of your selected target.

 - Load the firmware image to your development board.
 - Use an Ethernet cable to connect your development board to the local area network. The PC is assumed to be already in this LAN.

**PC Software**

The web server can be tested on any PC using any browser available. Simply, type in the **Local Host Name** that is
defined in the `Net_Config.h` file. The default name is **my_host**. If you have a DCHP server in your network, you will be
automatically connected. You need to log in. As for all network examples, use "admin" (without the quotes) for the user and
no password (you can change the defaults in the `Net_Config_HTTP_Server.h` file). The following (or a similar) page will
come up in your browser:

If you get an error message, please verify that all network, IP and other settings are correct.
