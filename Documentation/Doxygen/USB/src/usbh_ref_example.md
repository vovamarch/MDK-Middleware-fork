# USB Host Reference Application {#usbh_ref_example}

MDK Professional contains multiple example projects that show how to implement an USB Host. The following examples are
available for most of the development boards:

- The \subpage host_hid_tutorial example shows how to interact with an USB keyboard from a microcontroller.
- The \subpage host_msc_tutorial example shows how to access an USB memory stick from a microcontroller.

Here, it will be demonstrated using a USB to serial RS232 adapter with [Prolific PL2303](https://www.prolific.com.tw/US/index.aspx) UART-to-USB bridge chip.
